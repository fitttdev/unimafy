Hi there, I'm **Nima Yonten**!
I'm a software developer with experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails and every once in a while, I watch a very advanced programming to remind myself of the things I don't know. 


**Technology Stack**
  1. Ruby
  2. Ruby on Rails
  3. JavaScript
  4. Microservices Architecture
  5. CQRS & Event Sourcing

**Hot Take**

How you use the tool will greatly effect your opinions about it and result it
yields. You cannot complain that using a sledge hammer in place of a nail 
hammer is tool much effort. Obviously, you can be a big fan of slege hammer 
and use it for everything and dunk on the nail hammer community.
